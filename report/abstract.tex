In this project, we discuss the problem of galaxy morphological classification, where the input data contain five bands (u, g, r, i and z) instead of the typical three channel (RGB) images. We considered the binary case where a galaxy is either spiral or elliptical. The data we used came from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Zoo project.
We first performed Logistic Regression as a baseline, which gave a testing accuracy of $58.9\%$. Then we built a Convolutional Neural Network with five convolution layers that gave an accuracy of $98.5\%$ with around 18000 training data for each type. Obviously CNN gave a much more promising result comparing to Logistic regression for this problem, but further improvements should also be considered, for example, fine tuning the CNN. Also the accuracy of the `true' labels should also be further discussed since this part of the data is collected by crowdsourcing.
