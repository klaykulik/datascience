In this project, the problem of galaxy morphological classification into two main categories is discussed, where the input data contain five bands (u, g, r, i and z) instead of the typical three channel (RGB) images. 
The data used came from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Zoo project.
Logistic Regression was first performed as a baseline on on 10000 randomly sampled galaxies, which gave a testing accuracy of $58\%$. 
A Convolutional Neural Network with five convolution layers was then built, and it classified with an accuracy of $98.5\%$ using roughly 18000 training data of each type. 
Logistic Regression and the CNN are compared, with discussion on further improvements such as fine tuning the CNN.
Assumptions that the crowdsourced data are correctly classified are reviewed, and applications of a functional CNN are given. The full report and all supplemental scripts are publicly available on \href{https://github.com/klaykulik/galaxyCNN}{GitHub}
