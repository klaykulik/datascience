\section{Discussion}

The CNN model was trained and validated on the data that was crowd sourced, so it is fair to say that any bias and errors were also learned by the model. The model itself is not 100\% accurate so we can also speculate that the model is ideal, i.e., the missing accuracy was the human error. Furthermore, it would be interesting to compare the same model with image data (RGB) extracted for the same galaxies instead of `ugriz' channels. To do so, we can decide whether the extra information from the `ugriz' channels are actually useful (or how useful) for the classification of the galaxies.

From the results it is clear that we can employ a CNN model in practice. This particular model was only trained on a subset of the data available in GZ, with more training data and visualization of the weights at every layer we should be able to get a clear idea on what the model learned.
