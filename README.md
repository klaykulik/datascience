Computer Science 'Introduction to Data Science' group project. University of Western Ontario.

A convolutional neural network that classifies galaxies as spiral or elliptical. 

The input data from SDSS is composed of 5 filters ('ugriz') instead of the traditional RGB images.  

The data folder here is a small subset of the entire data that the CNN was trained on. The full dataset can be downloaded using the scripts provided in the script folder.
